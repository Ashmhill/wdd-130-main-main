			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p> My personal website, a workout tracker, aims to help users track their fitness progress, manage workout routines, and achieve their health goals effectively.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Designed for fitness enthusiasts, athletes, and individuals interested in maintaining an active lifestyle, the site provides tools and resources to organize workouts, monitor performance, and stay motivated on their fitness journey.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>To enhance the workout tracker website using JavaScript, I will implement dynamic features such as user-input forms for logging workout details like exercise type, duration, sets, and reps. JavaScript event listeners will handle form submissions, validate inputs, and update the DOM dynamically with logged data and calculated statistics such as total workout time and calories burned. Interactive charts from libraries like Chart.js will visualize progress over time based on logged workouts, while `localStorage` will store user data locally for persistence between sessions. Additionally, event handling will provide user feedback through notifications and dynamic UI updates, ensuring a personalized and interactive experience that motivates users to achieve their fitness goals effectively.</p>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
